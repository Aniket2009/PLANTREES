    <p> The projected increase in global temperatures by 5 degrees by 2025 is a cause for concern for the health and well-being of the planet. To address this issue, the #PLANTREES initiative has set a goal of planting 100000 trees by 2025. This initiative aims to mitigate the effects of climate change, and promote a more sustainable future for all living beings. </p>

                <p> The work of the #PLANTREES initiative is critical in ensuring that healthy seeds are planted in areas where trees are deficient. Deficit areas refer to locations where there is a lack of green cover, and planting trees can bring numerous benefits. By planting healthy seeds in such areas, the initiative hopes to increase the green cover and create a more sustainable ecosystem. </p>

                <p>By planting trees, the initiative aims to create a sustainable ecosystem that supports the health and well-being of all living beings. Trees act as natural air filters, absorbing pollutants and releasing clean oxygen into the atmosphere. They also help to prevent soil erosion, which can lead to the loss of fertile soil and damage to infrastructure.</p>
